# Spring Boot



What is Spring Boot?

- to simplify the development of Spring 
- a full integration of Spring framework
- a one-stop solution for J2EE



Microservice

- the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.

- in contrast with All In One 
- built around business capabilities and independently deployable



With Spring Boot, we can develop a microservice application quickly.
